Every other Monday from 2-3pm MT, we hold the ESDS Forum over [Google Meet](meet.google.com/mfb-whpi-tnj), which provides a venue for discussion, coordination and showcasing work in progress. Examples include:

- Workflow demos
- Overview of packages and analysis tools
- Focused discussions on new efforts
- Feedback on computing and analysis resources

This is a great place to discuss progress on your project, and get feedback from the community!
