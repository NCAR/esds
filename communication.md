# Communication

We use three primary platforms for communicating and collaborating. They include:

## [Discourse](https://discourse-nsa.ucar.edu/)

Discourse offers a community where users can ask questions and share progress on various projects. It is setup similarly to the [Pangeo discourse](https://discourse.pangeo.io/). You will need to register for an account, but once registered and logged on, be sure to follow the ESDS channel on this platform.

## [Zulip](https://zulip.ucar.edu/)

Zulip is an asynchronous messaging platform, run in-house at UCAR, which
can be used for both private messages and messages seperated by topic. When posting in a specific "channel", the user must add a topic, which makes it easier to track various conversations and refer back to communications at a later time.

## [ESDS Github Repository](https://ncar.github.io/esds/)

This repository and webpage is a space where we can post progress on this initiative, publish blog posts related to various workflows, document "best practices," in addition to serving as a resource/discussion spot via comments on pages and posts.
