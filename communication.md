# Communication

We use three primary platforms for communicating and collaborating. They include:

## [NSA Discourse](https://discourse-nsa.ucar.edu/)

Discourse offers a community where users can ask questions and share progress on various projects. It is setup similarly to the [Pangeo discourse](https://discourse.pangeo.io/). You will need to register for an account, but once registered and logged on, be sure to follow the ESDS channel on this platform.

## [Zulip](https://zulip.ucar.edu/)

Zulip is an asynchronous messaging platform, run in-house at UCAR, which
can be used for both private messages and messages seperated by topic. When posting in a specific "channel", the user must add a topic, which makes it easier to track various conversations and refer back to communications at a later time.

We recommend you join the ESDS Google Goup using [this link to the ESDS Group page](https://groups.google.com/a/ucar.edu/g/esds), then click "Join Group." New members to this Google Group will receive an invitation to join Zulip as well!

## [ESDS Github Repository](https://ncar.github.io/esds/)

This repository and webpage is a space where we can post progress on this initiative, publish blog posts related to various workflows, document "best practices," in addition to serving as a resource/discussion spot via comments on pages and posts.

## [ESDS Forum](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQeHIGSSz_8A8gZVL87xDjYXEwqB4CkRk85yf0TACb-rVgubjb3ukiulEYuUwHZGVXhgYNpaRC2SNAt/pub)

We have weekly meetings featuring presentations and discussions related to this project. If you are interested in the notes from these meetings, please check out [the agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQeHIGSSz_8A8gZVL87xDjYXEwqB4CkRk85yf0TACb-rVgubjb3ukiulEYuUwHZGVXhgYNpaRC2SNAt/pub)!

As with the Zulip, we recommend you join the ESDS Google Goup using [this link to the ESDS Group page](https://groups.google.com/a/ucar.edu/g/esds), then click "Join Group."
