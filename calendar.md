# Calendar

Currently, we have a few different ways to give involved with the ESDS effort.

## ESDS Activities

### Work-in-Progress (WIP) Talks

Every other Monday, we hold WIP talks which are forums to present on a variety topics! Examples include:

- Workflow demos
- Overview of some package
- Focused discussions on some new effort

This is a great place to discuss progress on your project, and get feedback from the community!
