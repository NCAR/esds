# Calendar

Currently, we have a few different ways to give involved with the ESDS effort.

## ESDS Activities

### ESDS Forum

Every other Monday, we hold the ESDS Forum, which provides a venue for discussion, coordination and "Work In Progress" (WIP) talks.
Examples include:

- Workflow demos
- Overview of some package
- Focused discussions on some new effort

This is a great place to discuss progress on your project, and get feedback from the community!

If you are interested in giving a talk, be sure to sign up using [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tuv5vwGbjSKdJD5KLT0Zow8WCY0_zt35tTI6EIRGOk4/edit?usp=sharing)!
