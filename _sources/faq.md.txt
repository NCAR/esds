## Xarray and Dask

### General tips

1. Read the xarray documentation on [optimizing workflow with dask](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/dask.html#optimization-tips).
1. Keep track of chunk sizes throughout your workflow. This is especially important when reading in data using `xr.open_mfdataset`. Aim for 100-200MB size
   chunks.
1. Choose chunking appropriate to your analysis. If you're working with time series then chunk more in space and less along time.
1. Avoid indexing with `.where` as much as possible. In particulate `.where(..., drop=True)` will trigger a compute since it needs
   to know where NaNs are present to drop them. Instead see if you can write your statement as a `.clip`, `.sel`, `.isel`, or
   `.query` statement.

### How do I optimize reading multiple files using Xarray and Dask?

A good first place to start when reading in multiple files is [Xarray's multi-file documentation](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/io.html#reading-multi-file-datasets).

For example, if you are trying to read in multiple files where you are interested in concatenating over the time dimension, here is an example of the `xr.open_dataset` line would look like:

```python
ds = xr.open_mfdataset(
        files,
        # Name of the dimension to concatenate along.
        concat_dim="time",

        # Attempt to auto-magically combine the given datasets into one by using dimension coordinates.
        combine="by_coords",

        # Specify chunks for dask - explained later
        chunks={"lev": 1, "time": 500},

        # Only data variables in which the dimension already appears are included.
        data_vars="minimal",

        # Only coordinates in which the dimension already appears are included.
        coords="minimal",

        # Skip comparing and pick variable from first dataset.
        compat="override",
        parallel=True,
    )
```

### Where can I find Xarray tutorials?

See [videos](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/latest/tutorials-and-videos.html) and [notebooks](https://xarray-contrib.github.io/xarray-tutorial/).

### How do I debug my code when using dask?

An option is to use `.compute(scheduler="single-threaded")`. This will run your code as a serial for loop. When an error is raised you can use the `%debug`
magic to drop in to the stack and debug from there. See [this post](https://cherian.net/posts/python-debugging.html) for more debugging tips
in a serial context.

### `KilledWorker` X{. What do I do?

Keep an eye on the dask dashboard.

1. If a lot of the bars in the Memory tab are orange, that means your workers are running out of memory. Reduce your chunk size.

### Help, my analysis is slow!

1. Try subsetting for **_just_** the variable(s) you need for example, if you are reading in a dataset with ~25 variables, and you only need `temperature`, just read in temperature. You can specificy which variables to read in by using the following syntax, following the example of the temperature variable.

```python
ds = xr.open_dataset(file, data_vars=['temperature'])
```

1. Take a look at your chunk size, it might not be optimized. When reading a file in using Xarray with Dask, a "general rule of thumb" is to keep your chunk size down to around 100 mb.

For example, let's say you trying to read in multiple files, each with ~600 time steps. This is case where each file is very large (several 10s of GB) and using Dask to help with data processing is _essential_.

You can check the size of each chunk by subsetting a single DataArray (ex. `ds['temperature']`)

If you have very large chunks, try modifying the number of chunks you specify within `xr.open_mfdataset(files, ..., chunks={'lev':1, "time": 500})` where lev and time are vertical and time dimensions respectively.

Check to see how large each chunk is after modifying the chunk size, and modify as necessary.

1. You do not have enough dask workers

If you have a few large files, having the number of workers equal to to the number of input files read in using `xr.open_mfdataset` would be a good practice

If you have a large number of smaller files, you may not run into this issue, and it is suggest you look at the other potential solutions.

### I have to do lots of rechunking, but the rechunk step uses too much memory and kills my workers.

Try the [rechunker package](https://github.com/pangeo-data/rechunker).

### Writing to files in parallel

Distributed writes to netCDF are hard.

1. Try writing to `zarr` using `Dataset.to_zarr`.
1. If you need to write to netCDF and your final dataset can fit in memory then use `dataset.load().to_netcdf(...)`.
1. If you really must write a big dataset to netCDF try using `save_mfdataset` (see [here](https://ncar.github.io/xdev/posts/writing-multiple-netcdf-files-in-parallel-with-xarray-and-dask/)).

### My Dask workers are taking a long time to start. How can I monitor them?

Dask worker requests are added to the job queues on Casper and Cheyenne with the `cluster.scale()` method. After this method is called, you can verify that they are waiting in the queue with this command:

- `qstat -u <my_username>` on Cheyenne, and the same command will work on Casper after April 2021.

If you see no pending worker jobs, then verify that you have called `cluster.scale()`.

### Setting up Github Authentication

Beginning August 13, 2021, Github will no longer accept account passwords when authenticating git operations. There are essentially two options, which Github provides proper documentation for getting setup:

1. [Setup two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa)
1. [Connect to Github via SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
