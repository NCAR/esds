# Resources

## [GeoCAT](https://geocat.ucar.edu/)

The [Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit (GeoCAT) team](https://geocat.ucar.edu/) at NSF NCAR develops and contributes to resources and tools for geoscience data analysis and visualization. Below are several of the projects they support.

### [GeoCAT-comp](https://geocat-comp.readthedocs.io/)

GeoCAT-comp provides implementations of computational functions for operating on geoscience data. Many of these functions are inspired by functionality in NCL.

### [GeoCAT-viz](https://geocat-viz.readthedocs.io/)

GeoCAT-viz contains tools to aid in visualizing geoscience data, including convenience and plotting functions that are used to facilitate plotting with Matplotlib, Cartopy, and other visualization packages.

### [GeoCAT-examples](https://geocat-examples.readthedocs.io)

GeoCAT-examples provides a gallery of analysis and visualization examples replicating in Python the functionality and visualizations from example scripts on [NCL Applications page](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Applications/).

### [NCAR HPC Documentation](https://ncar-hpc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

User documentation for the NSF NCAR high-performance computing (HPC) and storage resources managed by CISL includes searchable information specific to HPC resources, storage systems, authentication procedures and others, as well as additional how-to articles and troubleshooting articles.

### [Pangeo](https://github.com/pangeo-data)

A community effort for big data geoscience.

### [UXarray](https://uxarray.readthedocs.io/)

The GeoCAT team also leads the software development efforts of [Project Raijin](https://raijin.ucar.edu/), implementing the UXarray package in collaboration with other academic and research partners.  UXarray strives to provide Xarray-like functionality for working with data on unstructured grids.

### [Project Pythia](https://projectpythia.org/)

Want to learn more about using Python, GitHub, or Jupyter Notebooks for Earth system data science? Project Pythia is a home for Python-centered learning resources that are open-source, community-owned, geoscience-focused, and high-quality. Check out [Project Pythia](https://projectpythia.org/) tutorials, examples, and other training materials here. Project Pythia shares several contributors with the ESDS community and is a resource we highly recommend.

### [Zen of Scientific Computing](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/zen-of-scicomp/#)

A group of researchers and software engineers put together a helpful guide for developing scientific software, detailing the nuances of working Python stacks and the difference between daily use cases and more foundational libraries.

### [NSF NCAR HPC Best Practices](https://arc.ucar.edu/knowledge_base/70549811)

If you are using NSF NCAR Computational and Information Systems Lab (CISL) resources such as Casper and Derecho, this is a great place to start with learning to make the most of your computing and storage allocations.
