# Projects

This page includes a list of ongoing projects related to the ESDS initiative!

## [GeoCAT](https://geocat.ucar.edu/)

### [GeoCAT-comp](https://geocat-comp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

GeoCAT-comp is computational component of the GeoCAT project. GeoCAT-comp provides implementations of computational functions for operating on geosciences data. Many of these functions originated in NCL and were translated into Python with the help of GeoCAT-comp; however, developers are welcome to come up with novel computational functions for geosciences data.

- [Version 1.0 Roadmap](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-comp/projects/1)
- [Version 1.1 Roadmap](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-comp/projects/2)

### [GeoCAT-viz](https://geocat-viz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

The GeoCAT-viz repo contains tools to help plot data, including convenience and plotting functions that are used to facilitate plotting geosciences data with Matplotlib, Cartopy, and possibly other Python ecosystem plotting packages.

### [GeoCAT-examples](https://geocat-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

This gallery contains visualization examples from many plotting categories of geosciences data (under the Gallery tab) and usage examples for the functions of the GeoCAT computational component, GeoCAT-comp (under the GeoCAT-comp Examples tab).

## Diagnostic Efforts

### [AMP Diagnostics](https://github.com/NCAR/CAM_diagnostics)

Python-based diagnostics focused on evaluation of the atmospheric component of CESM. Produces time series and climatology files, seasonal and annual mean maps and zonal averages, global mean statistics, and an optional static website.

### [Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM) Python Gallery](https://github.com/NCAR/ctsm_python_gallery)

A place to put sample workflows and tools that use CTSM model output.

### [Parallel Ocean Program (POP)-tools](https://github.com/NCAR/pop-tools)

Tools to support analysis of POP2-CESM model solutions.

### [Intake-esm](https://github.com/intake/intake-esm)

An intake plugin for parsing an Earth System Model (ESM) catalog and loading assets into xarray datasets.

### [Earth system model Catalog Generation Tools (ecgtools)](https://github.com/NCAR/ecgtools)

Tool which enables one to build intake-esm catalogs.

### [Funnel](https://github.com/NCAR/esds-funnel)

Package which enables extensible diagnostic workflows, connecting intake-esm catalogs with operators and derived variables.
