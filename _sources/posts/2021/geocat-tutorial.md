# Plotting with GeoCAT Tutorial

The NCAR/UCAR virtual Python Tutorial Seminar Series continues with two sessions highlighting the functionality developed by NCAR's GeoCAT team: 1) Plotting with GeoCAT on **Wednesday, August 25th** led by Anissa Zacharias and 2) `GeoCAT-comp` **September 8th at 1 PM Mountain Daylight Time** led by Alea Kootz. More information on the `GeoCAT-comp` tutorial TBA.

The content for the Plotting with GeoCAT tutorial is hosted on Anissa's [Plotting with GeoCAT Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/anissa111/plotting-with-geocat-tutorial).

## Preparation

- Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/anissa111/plotting-with-geocat-tutorial.git`

- Create a conda environment from the `environment.yml` by first navigating into the repository with `cd plotting-with-geocat-tutorial` and then running `conda env create -f environment.yml`

- Activate the environment by running `conda activate plotting-with-geocat-tutorial`

- Launch JupyterLab by running `jupyter lab`.

Alternatively, click on the "launch binder" button in the `README` on the repository

You may find it useful to refress your Python plotting techniques, as covered in Anissa's [Matplotlib Tutorial](https://youtu.be/EiPRIdHQEmE).
