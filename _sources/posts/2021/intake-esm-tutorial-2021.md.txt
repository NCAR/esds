# Intake-ESM Tutorial

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ProjectPythiaTutorials/intake-esm-tutorial_2021_12_08/main)

The Project Pythia Python Tutorial Seminar Series continues with the Intake-ESM Tutorial on **Wednesday, December 8 at 1 PM Mountain Standard Time**. This session will be led by [Max Grover](https://github.com/mgrover1).

The content for this tutorial is hosted in the `.ipynb` notebook file(s) within the `tutorial` directory of this repository.

## Bio

Max works as software engineer within the Climate and Global Dynamics Lab here at NCAR. He graduated with a B.S in meteorology from [Valparaiso University](https://www.valpo.edu/geography-meteorology/) in 2019 and will complete his M.S. in atmospheric science this spring at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://atmos.illinois.edu/).

He works on Python-based tools to support climate model evaluation and contributes to the Earth System Data Science initiative. His research in graduate school focused on using observational data collected during the RELAMPAGO-CACTI campaign in Argentina to study mesoscale convective dynamics, primarily utilizing mobile radar observations as well as GOES-16 satellite imagery. This is not his first time working at UCAR – he took part in the Unidata summer internship program in 2019, working with Ryan May on contributing METAR parsing functionality to MetPy, which motivated him to pursue a career in software engineering.

He enjoys hiking, visiting breweries, and spending time on the water (his summer job, prior to graduate school, was at a resort in southern Wisconsin where he worked as a tour boat captain on Delavan Lake). He is also a big fan of Hawaiian shirts, with a collection of more than 40.

## How-to-Run

**All of the tutorials in this organization can be followed by clicking the "Launch Binder" button at the top level or in each directory.**
