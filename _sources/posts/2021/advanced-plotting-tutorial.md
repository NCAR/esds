# Advanced Plotting Tutorial

The NCAR/UCAR virtual Python Tutorial Seminar Series continues with Advanced Plotting Techniques on **Wednesday, October 27th at 1 PM Mountain**. This session will be led by Anissa Zacharias.

The content for this tutorial is hosted on Anissa's [matplotlib-tutorial GitHub repository](https://github.com/anissa111/matplotlib-tutorial) (the same repository as her previous plotting tutorials).

## Preparation

If you did attend the previous plottling tutorials (and have cloned this repository before):

- Stash their local changes with `git add .` and `git stash`

- Pull in upstream changes to the repository with `git pull`

- Update the conda environment with `conda env update -f environment.yml`

If you did not attend the past plotting-related tutorials:

- Check your conda install if this is the first tutorial in the series you are joining us for with `conda --version` and if necessary [install by following these instructions](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

- Navigate to Anissa's [Matplotlib Tutorial Github Repository](https://github.com/anissa111/matplotlib-tutorial).

- Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/anissa111/matplotlib-tutorial`

- Create a Conda environment from the `environment.yml` file with the terminal by first moving into the `matplotlib-tutorial` directory with `cd matplotlib-tutorial` and then typing `conda env update --file environment.yml`

- Activate your environment in the terminal with `conda activate matplotlib-tutorial`.

- Test your installation by launching JupyterLab with `jupyter lab`.

It would be beneficial to review the past plotting-related tutorials: [Matplotlib](https://youtu.be/EiPRIdHQEmE), [Cartopy](https://youtu.be/ivmd3RluMiw), and [Plotting with GeoCAT](https://youtu.be/It231le1fAU).
