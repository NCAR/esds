## What is it?

This is a follow on to the [From Jupyter Notebook to Web Server: Containerizing Interactive Visualizations](https://www.cisl.ucar.edu/events/jupyter-notebook-web-server-containerizing-interactive-visualizations) workshop held on June 20th, 2024. It is not a prerequisite that participants attended that event. A [recording](https://youtu.be/Bhj2KdZcK70) of that workshop is available to review.

Participants will be guided through automation techniques available via GitHub for building container images and updating on-premise cloud applications. Attendees will develop a GitHub Action workflow to build a container image and push it to Docker Hub. The workshop will also cover creating a Helm chart, an application configuration, that can be used to deploy to the On-premise cloud pilot. The session further delves into using GitHub Actions to update the Helm chart with new build information and how it can enable an automation strategy known as GitOps. Here is a [link to the code repository](https://github.com/NicholasCote/nbviz-to-container) containing a notebook that walks through the workshop content.

## Who should attend?

All UCAR staff interested in using GitHub actions for automation. It will focus specifically on using GitHub actions to build containers and update Helm charts used for on-premise cloud deployments.
