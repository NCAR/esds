# ESDS at SciPy 2023

ESDS had a sizable presence at [SciPy 2023](https://www.scipy2023.scipy.org/) this year! Many of us shared our work in a formal capacity through tutorials, talks, and posters–most of these were recorded and have resources available publicly online, which we’ve compiled below. There were also lots of opportunities to make connections with people doing work in the broader scientific Python ecosystem outside of our organization. It was very cool to see lots of different tools, projects, and workflows.

The [conference proceedings](https://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/) from this and prior years are now published as well.  You can find published slides, posters, and articles for some of the conference’s presentations at the link above.
