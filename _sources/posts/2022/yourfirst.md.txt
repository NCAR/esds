# The Python Tutorial Series Returns this Summer!

The Python Tutorial Series returns on every other Thurday at 1 PM Mountain starting May 26th with the 5-part "Your First" Python Tutorial series. The first lesson, "Opening a `.txt` File", covers how to create your first Python script to open some simple data. Some tutorials will be 1-off lessons on specific topics, while others will span multiple sessions.

We will begin by following through the [Xdev tutorial website](https://ncar.github.io/python-tutorial/), designed to introduce Python to scientists who already have a good deal of programming experience, albeit with a different language. Our main audience is NCAR scientists, but anyone who has some experience working in the terminal and understanding of basic coding structures who wants geoscience-applicable examples will find this tutorial series helpful and reqarding.
