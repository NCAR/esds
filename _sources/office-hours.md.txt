# Office Hours

Have a question about Python/data analysis issues? Looking to get feedback on some project? Set up an "office hours" appointment!

Several ESDS members are prepared to answer your Python questions via 1-on-1 appointments. You can now select the ESDS member with the specialization best equipped for your question, find a time that works for you, and generate an appointment. Please also provide how you'd like to meet (in-person or virtual) and a brief description of your question.

If your question is about an error message you are raising in your workflow, help us help you by being ready to provide a copy of your dataset and code so we can reproduce your error. Depending on your question, we may be able to walk you through a solution or send you documentation/resources that address your question.

**NOTE:** Office hours are designed for NSF NCAR and UCAR staff.
