# Best Practices

## Helpful Templates

Thinking about starting a new project? It can be helpful to use a template so you are not starting from scratch.

### [Package Template](https://github.com/andersy005/template)

Anderson Banihirwe ([@andersy005](https://github.com/andersy005)) created a template repository for packages, which includes automated code-quality checkers. This can be a helpful place to start.

### [Analysis Repository](https://github.com/jbusecke/cookiecutter-science-project)

Within the Pangeo community, Julius Busecke ([@jbusecke](https://github.com/jbusecke)) created the "Cookiecutter-Science-Project" repository which serves as a template when you are working with Jupyter notebooks. This repository walks you through setting up your repository and syncing it up through Github.

## Software Design

### [4+1 Software Architecture Model](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hVCuxtm0f8TzDqsy2kC5nnjqNt3rsz26qgcMQOnM0RY/edit?usp=sharing)

Currently, the ESDS group is experimenting with design documents for the next generation of diagnostics package. This is an example of the "4+1 View Model of Software Architecture" with an application to the diagnostics workflow. Feel free to use this example as a template!

### [Zen of Scientific Computing](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/zen-of-scicomp/#)

A group of researchers and software engineers put together a helpful guide for developing scientific software, detailing the nuances of working Python stacks and the difference between daily use cases and more foundational libraries.

## Managing Computational Resources

### [CISL Best Practices](https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/user-support/cisl-best-practices)

If you are using NCAR Computational and Information Systems Lab (CISL) resources such as Casper/Cheyenne, this is a great place to start with learning more making the most of your computing and storage allocations.
