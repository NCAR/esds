# Dask Tutorial UPDATED DATES

The NCAR/UCAR virtual Python Tutorial Seminar Series continues with a 2-part introduction to the Python package `dask` on **Wednesday, July 28th** and **August 11th at 1 PM Mountain Daylight Time**. These sessions will be led by Anderson Banihirwe.

**Note:** These dates have changed from the previous Dask Tutorial announcement.

The content for this tutorial is hosted on Anderson's [Xarray Tutorial Github Repository](https://github.com/andersy005/xarray-tutorial). This is the same repository as the previous Xarray tutorials.

- Update the conda environment with `conda env update -f binder/environment.yml`

If you did not attend the Xarray tutorials:

- Check your conda install if this is the first tutorial in the series you are joining us for with `conda --version` and if necessary [install by following these instructions](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
