# Xarray Tutorial

The NCAR/UCAR virtual Python Tutorial Seminar Series continues with a 2-part introduction to the Python package `xarray` on **Wednesday, June 9th** and **June 23rd at 1 PM Mountain Daylight Time**. These sessions will be led by Anderson Banihirwe.

The content for this tutorial is hosted on Anderson's [Xarray Tutorial Github Repository](https://github.com/andersy005/xarray-tutorial). However, since final edits are being made to these notebooks we ask that you please wait until after 1 PM MDT on June 8 to download the materials (the Tuesday before the first session). This will ensure that you have the latest version of the notebooks.

## Preparation

- Check your conda install if this is the first tutorial in the series you are joining us for with `conda --version` and if necessary [install by following these instructions](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

- Navigate to Anderson's [Xarray Tutorial Github Repository](https://github.com/andersy005/xarray-tutorial).

- Clone this repository by clicking the green "Code" button and copying the SSH address under the word "Clone". This can be done by clicking the clipboard icon.

- In your terminal, type `git clone PASTE` where you paste the SSH address you just copied (`git clone git@github.com:andersy005/xarray-tutorial.git`)

- Create a Conda environment from the `binder/environment.yml` file with the terminal by first moving into the `xarray-tutorial` directory with `cd xarray-tutorial` and then typing `conda env update --file binder/environment.yml`

- Activate your environment in the terminal with `conda activate xarray-tutorial`.

- Test your installation by launching JupyterLab with `jupyter lab`.
