# Numpy Tutorial

The NCAR/UCAR virtual Python Tutorial Seminar Series continues with an introduction to the Python package `numpy` on **Wednesday, March 10th at 1 PM Mountain**. This session will be led by Austin Kootz.

## Preparation

1. Check your conda install if this is the first tutorial in the series you are joining us for with `conda --version` and if necessary [install by following these instructions](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
2. Activate your tutorial environment from the last session on Jupyter notebooks with `conda activate jupyter_tutorial`
3. Install `numpy` and `matplotlib` with `conda install numpy matplotlib`

If you did not have a `jupyter_tutorial` environment (i.e. you did not attend the previous tutorial on Jupyter Notebooks), create one with all of the necessary packages for the session on `numpy` with `conda create --name jupyter_tutorial jupyterlab numpy matplotlib`

You can watch the recording from the live tutorial on Jupyter Notebooks [here](https://youtu.be/xSzXvwzFsDU).
