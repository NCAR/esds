# Cartopy Tutorial

The NCAR/UCAR virtual Python Tutorial Seminar Series continues with an introduction to the Python package `cartopy` on **Wednesday, April 28th at 1 PM Mountain**. This session will be led by Michaela Sizemore.

The content for this tutorial is hosted on Michaelsa's [Cartopy Tutorial Github Repository](https://github.com/michaelavs/cartopy_tutorial)

## Preparation

- Check your conda install if this is the first tutorial in the series you are joining us for with `conda --version` and if necessary [install by following these instructions](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

- Navigate to Michaela's [Cartopy Tutorial Github Repository](https://github.com/michaelavs/cartopy_tutorial).

- Clone this repository by clicking the green "Code" button and copying the SSH address under the word "Clone". This can be done by clicking the clipboard icon.

- In your terminal, type `git clone PASTE` where you paste the SSH address you just copied (`git clone git@github.com:michaelavs/cartopy_tutorial.git`)

- Create a Conda environment from the `conda_environment.yml` file with the terminal command `conda env create -f conda_environment.yml`. Make sure you are in the local `cartopy_tutorial` directory for this step.

- Test your installation in the terminal with `conda activate cartopy_tutorial`.

If you did not attend the live session, it will be beneficial to watch the recording from the live tutorial on [Jupyter Notebooks](https://youtu.be/xSzXvwzFsDU) and on [Matplotlib](https://youtu.be/EiPRIdHQEmE) before the Cartopy session.
