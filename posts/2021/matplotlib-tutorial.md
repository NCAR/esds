# Matplotlib Tutorial

The NCAR/UCAR virtual Python Tutorial Seminar Series continues with an introduction to the Python package `matplotlib` on **Wednesday, March 24th at 1 PM Mountain**. This session will be led by Anissa Zacharias.

The content for this tutorial is hosted on Anissa's [matplotlib-tutorial GitHub repository](https://github.com/anissa111/matplotlib-tutorial). Primarily direct your attention to the `matplotlib-tutorial.ipynb`.

## Preparation

- Check your conda install if this is the first tutorial in the series you are joining us for with `conda --version` and if necessary [install by following these instructions](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

- If you already have Jupyter working correctly in an environment (perhaps called `jupyter_tutorial`) from your personal use or a past tutorial in this seminar series, activate it with `conda activate ENVNAME`. Then check that you have `numpy` and `matplotlib` installed with `conda list`. If installation is necessary, type `conda install matplotlib numpy`.

- If you do not have a Jupyter-ready tutorial (i.e. you did not attend the previous tutorials), create one with all of the necessary packages for the session on `matplotlib` with `conda create --name matplotlib_tutorial jupyterlab numpy matplotlib`.

If you did not attend the live session, it will beneficial to watch the recording from the live tutorial on [Jupyter Notebooks](https://youtu.be/xSzXvwzFsDU) before the Matplotlib session.
