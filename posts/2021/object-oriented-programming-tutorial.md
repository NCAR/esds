# Object Oriented Programming Tutorial

The NCAR/UCAR virtual Python Tutorial Seminar Series continues with an introduction to Object Oriented Programming on **Wednesday, April 14th at 1 PM Mountain**. This session will be led by Austin Kootz.

The content for this tutorial is hosted on Austin's [oop_hrrr_tutorial GitHub repository](https://github.com/pilotchute/oop_hrrr_tutorial).

## Preparation

- Check your conda install if this is the first tutorial in the series you are joining us for with `conda --version` and if necessary [install by following these instructions](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

_These commands are to be run in the terminal_

- Clone the GitHub repository locally with:
  `git clone https://github.com/pilotchute/oop_hrrr_tutorial`.

- Move into your new directory with:
  `cd oop_hrrr_tutorial`

- There is a file called `environment.yml` that lists all of the necessary packages for this session. Create a conda environment from this file with:
  `conda env create -f environment.yml`

- Avtivate the environment:
  `conda activate oop_tutorial`

- And test that it runs correctly by launching Jupyter:
  `jupyter lab`

If you did not attend the live session, it will beneficial to watch the recording from the live tutorial on [Jupyter Notebooks](https://youtu.be/xSzXvwzFsDU) before the Object Oriented Programming session.
