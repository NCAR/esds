# ESDS Update October 2021

October has been an active month! There were a variety of talks, a variety of answered Python questions during office hours, and a Python tutorial!

Check out the following ESDS update for the month of October 2021.

## Xdev Updates

Xdev has made some important advances on [`Intake-ESM`](https://intake-esm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is a data catalog utility comprising an API to data assets. Essentially, intake-esm "abstracts away" the file system, enabling data search and discovery, automated queries and dataset construction, and portability across cloud and HPC platforms. We're now working on a set of ideas we're calling **_Funnel_**; this extends the data catalog with "analysis recipes", providing an effective strategy for modularization and extensibility of workflows.

We also held our first discussion on `xwrf`, which is a new package meant to bring Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) data into the Pangeo Ecosystem! Using this tool, users can read WRF output directly into `Xarray`, enabling the use of `Dask` and `hvPlot`. If you are interested in following along with that development, be sure to check out the [`xwrf` repository](https://github.com/NCAR/xwrf).

## Office Hour Questions

During the month of October 2021, our team answered a total of **14 questions** at our weekly [Xdev Office Hours](https://ncar.github.io/esds/calendar/#xdev-office-hours).

Below is a summary of the most common questions brought up during office hours!

![october-2021-office-hours](../images/october_2021_question_topics.png)

### Matplotlib Questions

- How do you adjust the colorbar size, spacing?
  - Suggested adding to the `pad` argument
- How to plot a basic map using matplotlib?
  - Suggested checking out the [Cartopy Content on the Pythia Foundations Page](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/core/cartopy/cartopy.html)
- How do you adjust the colorbar?
  - Pointed to [matplotlib colorbar documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.colorbar.html)

### Dask Questions

- How do you get dask to work with stacking CESM2-LE data?
  - Worked on an example subsetting the data, developing pipeline
- How to submit jobs with different schedulers?
  - Suggested checking out [Dask jobqueue options](http://jobqueue.dask.org/en/latest/)
- What is the most efficient way to compute annual means from a bunch of Earth System Prediction (ESP) data?
  - For some cases, makes sense using the preprocess function when the files are big enough (ex. ESP Decadal Prediction datasets)
    - Good case for preprocess - calculating annual means with files ~10s of GB in size
    - Bad case for preprocess - working with many smaller files, which leads to a large number of tasks and a slower process

### Xarray Questions

- How do you optimize file read in with ESP data?
  - Make sure to know when to use the preprocess function with computations
- How to use one dataset to mask another with different dims?
  - Needed to create a loop and create new dimensions for the datasets
