# 2024 Earth System Data Science (ESDS) Annual Event

ESDS is hosting an annual event on **January 18th and 19th** (Thursday-Friday).
This event will be hybrid, in-person in NCAR's Mesa Lab Main Seminar Room as well as
virtual.

The event will be hosted at the Mesa Lab Main Seminar Room, located at 1850 Table Mesa Dr, Boulder, CO 80305. In order to attend the event virtually, registered participants will be receiving an email from Taysia Peterson roughly one week prior to the event with Zoom details.

Please register for the event through the [Registration Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdidNODueH39lmDopDQ6MLSScN2Gk2S0-IAZ_VAJINnfzLdxA/viewform?usp=sf_link) by **Friday, January 5, 2024**!

The 2024 ESDS Annual Event will cover tutorials on Python, Git, the NCAR Environment,
JupyterHub, Xarray, Dask, and Interactive unstructured grids visualization with UXarray!
There will also be breakout groups for collaborative work and discussions on topics of
interest to attendees (eg, Python basics, packages, and analysis needs). Check out the
details of the event in the [2024 Annual ESDS Event Agenda](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XNZW8NWoF2LaQ4mlo8c06lNnNVJ0ndTG_DfFH8KsatQ).

Please consider submitting a [hackathon or discussion group proposal](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ju8yN5ydW1vvnBCoksXoYlxqL3ssrN8x6sZhfUJ_nYE) ahead of January 5th. Our goal is to encourage small group collaborations.

We are looking forward to seeing you all at the event!
