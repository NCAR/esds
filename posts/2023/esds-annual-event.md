The 2024 ESDS Annual Event will cover tutorials on python and git, the NCAR environment,
interactive visualization, dask, xarray, and more! There will also be breakout groups and

  we will go over use cases, Q&A, and individual trouble shooting on each
  topic during its session.

**Day 2 (Friday, January 19th):**

Please consider submitting a [hackathon or discussion group proposal](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ju8yN5ydW1vvnBCoksXoYlxqL3ssrN8x6sZhfUJ_nYE/edit#slide=id.g29c40fd2a1f_2_0)
