The 2024 ESDS Annual Event will cover tutorials on python and git, the NCAR environment,
interactive visualization, dask, xarray, and more! There will also be breakout groups and
discussions on topics of interest to attendees (eg, Python basics, packages, and analysis

Here is the content schedule:

**Day 1 (Thursday, November 10th), Mesa Lab Main Seminar Room and Online:**


* Starred events are planned to have a "flipped classrooom" format, where
  participants will be asked to watch tutorial recordings ahead of time, and
  we will go over use cases, Q&A, and individual trouble shooting on each
  topic during its session.

**Day 2 (Friday, November 11th):**

Please consider submitting a [hackathon or discussion group proposal](ADD LINK HERE)
ahead of January 5th. Our goal is to encourage small group collaborations.
