    "Lately, I’ve been working on a project that compares modeled and measured data, which is pretty standard. The measured data is on a Gregorian calendar (meaning there are leap years), and the modeled data is on a 365-day no-leap calendar. This is a pretty standard occurrence, so there are tools available in pandas and xarray to help. But finding the correct steps across the many platforms that host documentation can be difficult -- so let me add one more platform: *this blog*."

    "At several moments I seriously considered writing my own functions to deal with date-time. When I talked to some of my friends (who are scientists) about it, they confessed to me that they had each written their own function for dealing with this. This is a problem. One of the tenants of the Pangeo community is making it so scientists aren’t all repeating the same work when encountering similar problems. I couldn’t write my own function for time, it was my job to demonstrate how to use the tools already approved by the Pangeo community. But it felt like all of the tools worked differently in different scenarios. I had to navigate the documentation to figure out the when and why of time. "
