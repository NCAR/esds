# ESDS Collaboratory

Are you facing data or software challenges in your scientific workflows? Bring your work down to the Damon Room in the Mesa Lab on Wednesday November 19th, 2025!

ESDS team members will be in the library from 8AM to 4PM to answer questions and exchange ideas. Feel free to come all day or just pop in whenever is convenient.

These in-person working events will provide opportunities to encourage collaboration and communication between technical staff and the scientific community. Future events will rotate between the Foothills and Mesa Lab buildings.
