# ESDS Collaboratory

Are you facing data or software challenges in your scientific workflows? Bring your work down to the Mesa Lab library on Wednesday June 25, 2025 for the first ever ESDS Collaboratory!

ESDS team members will be in the library from 9AM to 4PM to answer questions and exchange ideas. Feel free to come all day or just pop in when convenient.

These in-person working events will provide opportunities to encourage collaboration and communication between technical staff and the scientific community. Future events will rotate between UCAR buildings.
