## What is it?

This workshop guides participants through the process of transforming
an interactive visualization from a Jupyter Notebook into a
Python-based web server. Attendees will learn how to create and run
a containerized version of the web server, gaining practical skills
in containerization and deployment. Additionally, the workshop will
explore automation techniques for building container images and
introduce hosting options available via the CISL On-premise Cloud
Pilot, empowering participants to leverage cloud infrastructure for
their projects. Here is a [link to the code
repository](https://github.com/NicholasCote/nbviz-to-container)
containing a notebook that walks through the workshop content.

## Who should attend?

All UCAR staff interested in creating containers to host Python based
interactive visualizations as web servers.
