# Key Takeaways from the AMS 2022 Python Symposium

This week as the 102nd Annual Meeting of the American Meteorological Society, and the 12th Symposium on Advances in Modeling and Analysis Using Python. It was originally scheduled to take place in Houston, Texas, but due to COVID-19, was moved to a purely virtual conference. Despite being virtual, this week included an inspiring variety of talks/discussions around the current state of various Python packages, educational efforts, and tips/tricks to computing at scale.

This post will focus on sessions related to the Python Symposium, including:

- Working with Large Datasets Using Python
- Teaching, Training, Outreach, and Building Communities around Python Combined with Research to Operations
- Python Tools in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences. Part I
- Python Tools in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences. Part II
- Tuesday Poster Session
- FAIR and Open Data and Software within the Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences to Support Replicable Research and Reusable Tools for Climate Analysis. Part I (Joint Session)
- Cloud Computing for Big Data in Atmosphere, Ocean, and Climate (Joint Session)

For each of these sessions, I'll provide a link to where you can find the session information and the recording! For those who registered for AMS this year, the recordings are available ~48 hours after the session. Others can accesss the recordings ~3 months after the conference (which occurred January January 23-27, 2022).

For each talk, I provide a few key takeaways. I encourage you to watch the recording/reach out the presenters to follow up (especially to give them kudos for a job well done!).
