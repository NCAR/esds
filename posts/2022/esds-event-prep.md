# Preparation for a (Re)Introduction to Earth System Data Science (ESDS) Across NCAR/UCAR/UCP

ESDS is hosting a (Re)Introduction to Earth System Data Science (ESDS) Across
NCAR/UCAR/UCP on **November 10th and 11th** (Thursday-Friday). This event will
be hybrid, in-person in NCAR's Mesa Lab Main Seminar Room and virtual over Zoom
or Google Meet. More information is in this [previous post](esds-fall-event.md).

## Environment Install

### Binder

This tutorial is designed to be run from Binder. You can do that by navigating to the [GeoCat Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-tutorials) and selecting ["Launch Binder"](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NCAR/geocat-tutorials/main) in the `README.md`.

Essentially, Binder is a web service that hosts Jupyter Notebooks in an immediately executable and reproducible way. [Learn more about Binder](https://mybinder.org/). For more information on Jupyter Notebooks, review the [Jupyter Project Pythia content](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/getting-started-jupyter.html).

### Local Install

For those of you who prefer to work on your local machine, please install Miniconda and Jupyter before the ESDS event.

You can follow the [Project Pythia instructions to install Python on Jupyter](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/jupyter.html).

If you have trouble installing miniconda - try to uninstall and reinstall it, making sure you select the correct install location.

Once installed, you will follow the "local installation instructions" in the [GeoCat Tutorials Repository `README.md`](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-tutorials#readme).

If you have any aditional questions, feel free to reach out to Julia Kent at jkent@ucar.edu.
The 08:40 - 09:30: Python Intro and Workspace Set Up slot on Day 1 will be for troubleshooting any problems that we could not resolve beforehand.

## Session homework

The events on Day 1 will follow a flipped classroom model, where you watch some tutorials and do study on your own before coming together in your breakout group to troubleshoot, ask questions, or dive deeper. To get the most out of these sessions, please complete the prep work selected by each session leader.

The breakout groups are:

- [Python Basics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ku15eYYGFujpGaiabJCDL4Lo8WBJilG5x2GbjMsjsNU/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Numpy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fCLZaJwQxiV12QHAwVuu5fHv5h6Atoq9xT_rdnEX3OM/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Visualization](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pCZNh1NToWETMBwHQr-rj12l-ABJQpdEXK8-IGa6r4E/edit?usp=sharing)

Each section links to a Google Doc with the viewing homework.

We look forward to seeing you on November 10th!
