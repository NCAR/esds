# New Office Hours Appointment System

The ESDS office hours are moving to an [appointment scheduling page](office-hours/).

The previous office hours system was two one-hour blocks at the same time every week via a Zoom call where software engineers sit in and await scientists to show up and receive help. This was not ideal because some weeks no one showed up (which eventually leads to attrition of software engineers), and other weeks many people showed up and could not all receive the individualized help they needed. Also we had many software engineers and scientists with scheduling conflicts during these two static time blocks. You may have noticed these are no longer on the ESDS calendar.

Now you can select a software engineer with a specialty most closely related to your question and find a time to meet with them. Or you could just find the next available software engineer to meet with.

A good amount of time went into researching the scheduling service, securing funding for it, and getting approval from UCAR security, so we are very pleased that the service is now LIVE!

Since this is still new, please be patient and let us know if you have any difficulty using the service.

If you'd like to be added as a potential office hours "staff" please reach out, and we'll get you set up.
