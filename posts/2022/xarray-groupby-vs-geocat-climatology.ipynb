    "When using data that has a daily or finer resolution (e.g. hourly), calculating an annual average is simple. Every day and hour has the same length, so an unweighted average will work.\n",
    "\n",
    "But when using data that is monthly, things can get a bit tricky. Not every month is created equal. February has 28 or 29 days and March has 31 days. Since monthly data has one value for each month, those points can't be averaged in the usual way. A weighted average is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is tempting to quickly compute monthly to annual averages with `Xarray`'s `resample` or `groupby` functions, we need to be careful to specify the weights. Unfortunately, `Xarray` doesn't support weighted `resample` or `groupby` at the time this post was created.\n",
