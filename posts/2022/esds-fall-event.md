# A (Re)Introduction to Earth System Data Science (ESDS) Across NCAR/UCAR/UCP

ESDS is hosting a (Re)Introduction to Earth System Data Science (ESDS) Across
NCAR/UCAR/UCP on **November 10th and 11th** (Thursday-Friday). This event will
be hybrid, in-person in NCAR's Mesa Lab Main Seminar Room and virtual over Zoom
and/or Google Meet.

Please register to the event through the [Registration

The ESDS Fall event will cover a (re)introduction to the NCAR ESDS Initiative;
include breakout groups and discussions on Python basics, packages, and analysis
needs; and provide tutorials of the Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit
