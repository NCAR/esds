# A (Re)Introduction to Earth System Data Science (ESDS) Across NCAR/UCAR/UCP

ESDS is hosting a (Re)Introduction to Earth System Data Science (ESDS) Across NCAR/UCAR/UCP on **November 10th and 11th** (Thursday-Friday). This event will be hybrid, in-person in NCAR's Mesa Lab Main Seminar Room and virtual over Zoom.

The ESDS Fall Event will cover a (re)introduction to the NCAR ESDS Initiative and include breakout groups and discussions on Python packages and analysis needs. The event will culminate in a hackathon (NCAR/UCAR personnel only) on Friday.

Here is an approximate content schedule:

Day 1:

- Intro to ESDS
- Python Intro and Workspace Set Up
- Python Syntax Basics\*
- Breakout groups on Numpy, Visualization, Xarray, and Dask\*

Day 2:

- Intro to GeoCAT
- GeoCAT-viz
- GeoCAT-comp
- UXarray
- WRF-Python
- GeoCAT on NCAR's HPC clusters
- Hackathon and focused group discussions (UCAR/NCAR only)

* Starred events are planned to have a "flipped classrooom" format, where participants will be asked to watch tutorial recordings ahead of time, and we will go over use cases, Q&A, and individual trouble shooting on each topic during its session.

Stay tuned for an announcement when **registration opens on October, 20th**.
