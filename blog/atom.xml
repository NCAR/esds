    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;More than a year ago, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/staff/mclong/"&gt;Matthew Long&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://staff.ucar.edu/users/kpaul"&gt;I&lt;/a&gt; started shopping around the idea that a
lot of what we do here at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ncar.ucar.edu/"&gt;NCAR&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; we do
it, needed a bit of a facelift. Our pitch was simple: As an institution that
supports the geoscientific community by providing valuable datasets, supercomputing
facilities, and computer models, NCAR needs to &lt;em&gt;exemplify&lt;/em&gt; modern best practices
in the &lt;em&gt;development&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; of these resources. We took inspiration from the
remarkably effective &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pangeo.io"&gt;Pangeo&lt;/a&gt; community, which continues to show
enormous success with Open Source development when coupled with modern software
best practices, and we started to develop a plan of how to help shift, albeit
slowly, both NCAR and—though collaboration with the Pangeo community—the
geoscience community toward a better future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To implement our plan, Matt and I started to see how much benefit to NCAR it could
be to have a small, Agile team that was dedicated to prototyping new technologies
for the benefit of the rest of the organization and the rest of the geoscience
community, as a whole, like the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/"&gt;UK Met Office&lt;/a&gt;’s
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.informaticslab.co.uk/"&gt;Informatics Lab&lt;/a&gt;. However, instead of just
churning out technology, this group would also serve as an example to the rest of
NCAR on how (and why) to use modern best practices (GitHub, continuous integration,
test-driven development, etc.) for scientific software development. …and for
science itself!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, I found myself rambling on in an unprepared attempt to
explain templating to a colleague of mine who had no prior experience
with frontend design. It didn’t take me long to realize that my
explanation was convoluted and confusing, not that I stopped talking,
mind you. Attribute that to being unprepared, or sleep deprived (i.e.,
child &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; not sleeping through the night!), or just a bad teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I decided to point them to a tutorial online that
&lt;em&gt;certainly must exist&lt;/em&gt;, but after a brief Google search (which you
should read as, “I didn’t find anything in the first page of search
results!”), all I could find were tutorials for frontend developers.
And if you aren’t an HTML expert, or already have experience with
Flask or Django, teaching templating in those contexts can actually
be more confusing than illuminating.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Because we are unable to host an in-person tutorial for this fall season, the Xdev team has decided to switch to a virtual seminar series. We will be hosting one hour tutorial sessions scheduled for the 2nd and 4th Wednesdays of each month at 1 PM Mountain starting in October. The first tutorial session, covering how to create your first Python script, will be on October 14th. Some tutorials will be 1-off seminars on specific topics, while others will span multiple seminar sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote tutorials offer their own challenges; no one from our team can walk around the room to notice if anyone needs technical help or one-on-one assistance during a challenging topic. We believe that one hour sessions make it easier for participants to reach out and get the help they need to catch up before the next session of a multi-part seminar, so that we can more effectively reach our education goals.&lt;/p&gt;

Increasing the individual worker to a higher amount (ex. 256 GB) solved the issue.
