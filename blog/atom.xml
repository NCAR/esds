Software that is used by the wider community should received the acknowledgment and recognition it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data and academic publication citations have become popular in the literature, but often times, software is not cited… which can be arguably just as important to the work as the data.&lt;/p&gt;

This led a post in which an example of spinning up dask clusters on the new configuration. This was also an opportunity to dig into dask, and try applying it to a sample task, specifically looking at ecosystem variables in the CESM-LE dataset, using notebooks included in Matt Long’s &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/matt-long/krill-cesm-le"&gt;krill-cesm-le repository&lt;/a&gt;, modified by Kristen Krumhardt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we spin up our dask cluster. At first, running this notebook resulted in a &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;killed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;worker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; error. After further expection, we noticed that additional resources would be needed to read in the notebook since the data are so large (on the order of ~1-2 TB). Increasing the individual worker to a higher amount (ex. 256 GB) solved the issue. Scale up to as many workers as you think are neccessary for the calculation (this may take some trial and error).&lt;/p&gt;
